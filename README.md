# BandSite

Project no. 2 of the BrainStation Online Web Development curriculum.

## Sprint I

This week, you will start a project for an up-and-coming band. The project will be broken into 3 parts (sprints of 1 week each). You will be required to build a website, and all required functionality over the next 3 weeks. Each week has a required deliverable. Creative mock ups and design specs will be provided, and your task is to use the mock ups and requirements to create a fully functional live site for the band.

For this sprint, you will be focused on building a responsive, web-site based on the provided mock ups and design specs.

## Sprint II

For this sprint, you have been provided some updated mock ups for an additional screen that will be part of the site, as well as some new features to be added. Another team is developing some back-end functionality for the new features that you will need to use for the following sprint, so for now you will implement these features in the browser using Javascript until the back-end is ready.

Your goal will be to make the site interactive using JavaScript, and to add a second page to the site according to the mockups and design specs.
